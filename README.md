A collection of tables and graphical representations of elementary statistics.

## Learnings

Figures can be abstracted into reusable classes. Figures are self-contained units, such as tables, that can be removed from the main flow of content.

Id attributes on a parent element are necessary to differentiate class instances from one another. This enables multiple class instances on the same page and the sharing of common HTML templates.

The Set data structure returns a collection of unique elements.
