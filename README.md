## Learnings

Figures can be abstracted into reusable classes. Figures are self-contained units, such as tables, that can be removed from the main flow of content.

Id attributes on a parent element are necessary to differentiate class instances from one another. This enables multiple class instances on the same page and the sharing of common HTML templates. [Example](https://github.com/nkabrown/multi-tables)

The Set data structure returns a collection of unique elements.
